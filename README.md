During the 2018 Fall semester, we were tasked to make a group of 3-5 students and create an
On-Demand Home Repair Services application using Android Studio. 

While making the app, students were told to focus on three main users which are the administrator, 
the homeowner, and the service provider. The administrator created the services which
were to be offered by the service providers and to the home owners. When logged in
under the service provider account, the user would be able to create a profile and select
which services they offer. The homeowner would then be able to search through a list of
services and book a provider.

The creation of this project engaged us in the Software Engineering practices we
learned in class. We also were able to apply our theoretical knowledge to something
more practical and taught us how to create UML diagrams and implement a design
based on the diagram. The building of this app was also a great opportunity to work in a
team and practice the Agile Software Development approach.

Overall, we found that this project was very interesting and challenging, especially
since most of us have never dabbled with app development before. Nevertheless, we
pulled through and met all criteria including the bonuses.
